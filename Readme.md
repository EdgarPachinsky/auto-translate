Hello, developer who is tired of translating in 11 languages, 
here we have created an automated program for you that will 
speed up the time-consuming and boring work.
_**Works with Google translator, employers won't complain!!**_

JUST DO 
`npm install` <br>
and then (t fot **translate**  )
`npm run t --text="some text for translate"`

**_!! Note <br>_**
If you getting any errors with `chromedriver` , just replace version in <br>
`package.json` file with your current `chrome browser` version

For example if you have `chrome` version of `108.*` then replace version of `chromedriver` in `package.json` file with this
`"chromedriver": "^108.0.0",`
